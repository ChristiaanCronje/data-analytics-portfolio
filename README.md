I help small businesses and online sellers understand their data to make better decisions.  
I work with Python and SQL to clean messy data, uncover trends, and provide actionable insights through reports and visualizations.  
My focus is on practical analytics - answering questions like: what’s driving sales, where money is being lost, and what actions to take next.  

This repository showcases selected analytics projects that turn raw data into insights clients can act on.
